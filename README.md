# 3DS Extended Homebrew Starter Pack

The original version was for a9lh and Luma 5.5 made by d0k3. I decided to update it and delete files that are outdated or not working with newer firmware

This is my personal, extended version of Smealums 3DS homebrew starter pack. It's built upon Smealums original homebrew starter pack available from [here](http://smealum.github.io/3ds/), and contains these softwares:

* Themely fork by ihaveamac
* FBI by Steveice10
* Luma CFW by AuroraWright
* Godmode9 by d0k3
* Decrypt9 by d0k3
* Some Godmode9 Scripts by various users.
* boot9strap by SciresM

If I missed any devs I will add them later. I will be adding more items later on.
