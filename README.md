# 3DS Extended Homebrew Starter Pack

This is my personal, extended version of Smealums 3DS homebrew starter pack. It's built upon Smealums original homebrew starter pack available from [here](http://smealum.github.io/3ds/), and contains these softwares:
* MenuHax Manager by Yellows8
* HANS by smealum
* CHMM2 by Rinnegatamante
* ftpd by mtheall
* mGBA by endrift
* prBoom by elhobbs
* Playcoin Setter by MrCheeze
* FBI by SteveIce10
* svdt by meladroit
* CTRXplorer by d0k3
* Decrypt9WIP by Archshift & d0k3
* GodMode9 by d0k3
* Luma3DS CFW by AuroraWright & reisyukaku
* TinyFormat by javiMaD
* Various installers and tools by smealum
* And more, will update with all names when I have the time

The original version was for a9lh and Luma 5.5 made by d0k3. I decided to update it and delete files that are outdated or not working with newer firmware
